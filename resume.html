          <h2> Neurogenomics, Enhancer and Regulatory Activity, and Vocal Learning </h2>
          <li> My current thesis work! Details soon to come (early 2024) following qualifying exams and proposal defense! </li>

          <h2> Guanine Quadruplex Formation affects RNA Polymerase II Pausing </h2>
          <li>The motivation of the lab was to look at novel ways to treat human disease.  To evaluate novel ways to treat human disease, we studied the modulation of transcription at various points, such as pausing of RNA Polymerase ii. In particular, we looked at how guanine quadruplex formation regulates pausing in RNA polymerase II, and from there, gene expression.</li>
          <li>A variety of tools have been developed to find sequences where G4s could likely develop and cause transcriptional changes using G-richness and G-skewness. Our results suggested that quadruplexes are enriched in environmentally responsive genes, rather than primarily being a genetic response.</li>
          <li>This could potentially be used in future research and experimental medicine, as targeting G-quadruplexes with small molecules could be an attractive strategy to control the expression of proteins that cannot be targeted with current drugs or therapies.</li>
          <br>
          <h2> Allelic Imbalance in Crohn's Disease </h2>
          <li>Sequencing reads can be used to show digital estimates of allelic abundance at sites in the genome. These sites, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are genomic loci with alleles, anywhere from a singular base to millions of bases, that have some amount of heterozygosity, or differ in the nucleotide(s) present. At these heterozygous sites, it is possible to analyze how much signal comes from one allele, and if there is significant discrepancy in signal between the two alleles, it can provide evidence for some form of allelic imbalance at the site. A heterozygous SNP that does not change function at a site should have an equal signal between the two alleles, while an SNP with an altered site function will not. This can potentially be used to connect sites of allelic imbalance to disease mechanisms or phenotypes.</li>
          <li>In this project, we used WASP computational analysis software in order to run allelic imbalance analyses on ATAC-sequencing data from CD patients. After determining sites of common allelic imbalance among the patient data, we were able to link heterozygous sites to potential GWAS variants, and map regulatory regions to genes based on the linked variants.</li>
          <li>Future analysis could include comparison with allelic imbalance sites in gene expression (RNA-seq) experiments to evaluate pathway enrichment and gene interactions in various diseases and conditions.</li>
